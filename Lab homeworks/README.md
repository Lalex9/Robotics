# Laboratory homeworks:

1. potentiometersRGBControl:

Using three potentiometers, we control individual colors of a RGB LED.

2. knockDetectorWithButton:

Using a piezzo buzzer that detects knock,  we can play a song. When a knock is detected, it starts playing the Star Wars song on a loop, or until the button is pressed.

P.S. I used the 'pitches.h' header file with the notes and the melody for this asignment.
